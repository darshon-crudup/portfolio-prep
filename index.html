          <h2>What do I Want My Career to be About?</h2> 
          <p>I'd like to apply my new skills to a career in tech which utililizes my ability to be creative in real-world projects.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Professional Pitch</h2>
          <p class="pitch">My name is Darshon Crudup.  I'm an Army Veteran originally from New Jersey.  I've been living in Georgia for six years and relocated from my home state to pursue my interests in Graphic Design.  Prior to me deciding to change careers I enjoyed working in New York as a Production Assistant learning different aspects of the Film industry.  I enjoyed working on commercials and product advertisements.  I was also fortunate for the opportunity to create my own short film.  I've always had a passion for the arts, entertainment, graphic design, and technology.  I'm here to further my education in software development to embark on a new career path.  I noticed when I searched for jobs that I always lacked one aspect of the position; software development.  All of my dream jobs seemed to want this skill set in addition to the ability to design.  This is one of the main reasons why I decided to learn software development.  I picked this particular skill because it can benefit my personal entrepreneurial goals and open up the doors for job opportunities.  I think my ideal environment would be in software, creative media, or security.  My previous graphic design experiences give me a boost in my new career.  I've always had a natural eye to create and produce good visuals.  It is this unique combination of creativity and design I possess which may give me a slight edge on my new career in tech.
